# Encryption App

This Encryption App is a web-based application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a secure encryption algorithm. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), this app provides a user-friendly interface for text encryption and decryption.

The front-end, developed with React, features a sleek and responsive design with a gradient background and glassmorphism effects. It offers three main sections: input for plain text, display for encrypted text, and display for decrypted text. The back-end, powered by Node.js and Express, handles the encryption and decryption processes using the AES-256-CBC algorithm.

Key features include:
- Real-time encryption and decryption
- Secure handling of sensitive data
- Visually appealing and intuitive user interface
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

This project serves as a practical demonstration of implementing encryption in a web application while maintaining an attractive and user-friendly design. It's ideal for educational purposes or as a starting point for more complex encryption-based applications.
